Segment your customers for fencing

- In every market, you find customers who are more price-driven than others. Instead of deciding whether you want to serve the price-driven segment, the value-driven segment, or the premium segment, you can use pricing to address each of them with a different offer. What you need to do to achieve this is fencing, to put the fence between the different segments you are serving. Let me give you a simple example. A movie theater offers reduced ticket prices to students. Here, the student ID is a fence between one segment, the students, and all other segments. Another good example for fencing are the coupons that you find on your phone. Because the convenience buyer, the one who appreciates the convenience, wouldn't bother with the coupons. She or he just goes to the store and buys the orange juice and pays the full price. However, the price seeker, a different segment of the market who wants a low price, he or she would actually care about the coupon, drive to the store, and redeem the coupon for a discount. So in this sense, the coupon is a way to fence price buyers from convenience buyers. And for me, the coupon is almost the best fence there is. Because the retailer doesn't need to segment customers by their willingness to pay. You don't need market research to figure out who is a convenience buyer and who is a price buyer, because the customers segment themselves. So if you come with the coupon, well, you're a price buyer. If you don't come with the coupon, and pay the full price, you're a convenience buyer. So the idea here is that the coupon serves as a fence between two different segments. Clearly, the profitability of this fencing strategy is based on the fact that you don't give a discount to customers who don't need a discount. And this has a huge impact on your profit margin. But fencing can be much more sophisticated and lucrative than this. The case of Xiameter illustrates this perfectly. Dow Corning, who sells silicone to business-to-business customers, did a market study on what customers really want. And what they found out is that there are different segments in all industries they are serving. But one segment was always present, the price seeker segment. These are companies who would always buy the cheapest silicone in the market. Other segments need R&D, some need more services, et cetera. Based on this insight, Dow Corning created a separate company called Xiameter. Xiameter would be the company that serves the low end of the market. And for their established customers who do value and pay for research and service and better delivery, the Dow Corning brand would be used. The limited range of products and services worked as a fence. If you want Dow Corning, pay for Dow Corning. But if you only want the lowest price, buy online at our daughter brand, Xiameter. What does this mean for your business? You can capture the willingness to pay from the price buyers with a low end offering, and at the same time, you can capture the willingness to pay for the convenience buyers or the value buyers, and charge a much higher price in that segment. The key is that you identify those segments and create smart fences around them.



Define your price carrier strategically

- An important question you need to address is not how much you're going to charge but for what. In other words, where do you put the price tag on? This is what we call the price carrier decision. For example, when we lived in Phoenix, Arizona I would sometimes go to McDonald's with my two kids. What McDonald's offered was more than burgers, fries, and drinks. It offered an air-conditioned playground, which is like heaven on earth when the outside temperature hits 116 degrees Fahrenheit.

While the full offer was value to me McDonald's only charges for burgers and fries but not for the playground. In other words, the price carrier is burgers and fries. The price carrier decision also includes the question whether you should sell your total offer as a bundle for one price or whether you should sell each component separately. Other price carrier decisions are making a difference between input and output. For example, when you hire a lawyer do you want to pay her by the hour, which is input, or by the result, which is a percentage of the sum you are awarded or a success fee. Deciding on a price carrier is more than just a pricing decision. It can change your relationship with your customers. It can change your operations, your quality, and sometimes it can change your business model altogether. A famous case on price carrier change is Adobe. A couple of years ago, Adobe announced that it will stop selling live flow licenses for its Adobe Creative Suite programs that include Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, and many more. The new price carrier will be a monthly subscription. For a fee of say $50, the customer gets access to the full Adobe Creative Cloud. Less expensive subscriptions are available for students or for limited packages. This was a bold move by Adobe for mainly two reasons. First of all, the initial reaction by the users remained a negative. Secondly, Adobe's revenue would initially drop because no more licenses for $2,500 would be sold. However, Adobe's change to a cloud-based pricing also allowed them to move to a cloud-based business model with many advantages. Distribution and production costs are much lower. Updates are much more frequent. But most importantly, Adobe could observe product usage much more directly and in real time, which helps the company to develop new features faster and more effective. What does this mean for you? I suggest that you make a list of all your services and products, and that you write down how you charge for them. What are the price carriers? Secondly, challenge yourself by exploring what would happen if you changed those price carriers? What if you go from an hourly fee to a fixed fee or to a performance-based fee? What if you start charging different rates for different parts of your service instead of a fixed daily rate? What if you can charge for a subscription? In my experience, the price carrier decision offers new opportunities to increase your profitability with value-based pricing.



Forget variable costs, radically

- Let's talk about why value-based pricing is more profitable than cost-based pricing, and why you need to know your costs nonetheless. If I'm running a summer camp on computer programming, I can calculate that I need 40 kids, each family paying $250 to cover my cost of $10,000. This will be cost-based pricing. However, being a parent myself, I know that the willingness to pay for computer programming summer camp is much higher. I can decide to set the price to $400 per student. This would lead to $10,000 in revenue with just 25 students and the record of $16,000 in revenue with 40 students. Value-based pricing is more profitable. As a pricing expert, I like it. As a parent, yeah, I don't. Let's assume that you are running a bookstore, and you bought this book for $5. The regular price is $10 and nobody bought it for a year. It was just using up shelf space. Which price should you charge for this book? Now, you can say, well, I cannot go below $5 because then, I would lose some money because I paid $5 for it. But if you think about it, you've already paid the $5 whether you sell it or not. So actually, these $5 are considered sunk costs, and they should not matter. Keeping the price at $10 and not selling it is definitely worse than selling in it for $4. Of course, you'll go bankrupt if you always sell below your costs. But for this specific book, getting $4 is better than getting nothing. However, is it better to sell it now for $4 or keep it on the shelf with the hope that someone will buy it in the next 12 months? This depends on two different cost types. First, avoidable cost. In one option, the book will cost you for storage, handling, cleaning. In the other option, selling it now, these costs are zero. In other words, you need to consider avoidable costs when you compare to price tactics. As a rule of thumb, used car dealers calculate $30 avoidable costs for every day a car is not sold but stuck in the lot. Second, opportunity cost. This is an interesting discussion in real life. The question is how many other books could I sell in my store if I get rid of this book? Would I be able to sell a book each week with the space I gain from getting rid of unwanted books? What's the takeaway for your pricing decisions? As the bookseller case has indicated, you cannot just compare prices. You also need to compare alternative tactics by including respective avoidable costs and opportunity costs.
